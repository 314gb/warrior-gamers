# warrior-gamers
Final project for ICS 314
using the meteor framework.
throughout this semester we have learning all about the wonders of web dev.
now is the time for us to make a project using the things we have learned using:
- Basic HTML
- CSS
- Semantic framework
- javascript
- Meteor framework

we aim to create a gamer social platform for University of Hawaii students. It will require UH ID to login in to ensure the UH community user base. After login in, users can create their unique profile with their gaming interests and information. All user profiles are public within the community, and users can search for others with similar interests. We will collaborate with local gaming organizations and clubs for news and events that will be posted. We wish to bring gamers together and build connections.
